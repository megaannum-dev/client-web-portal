/* ============================================================
   MOBO — Reconciliation type layer (backend-aligned)

   Two layers live here, deliberately separated:

   1. DOMAIN types (`Order`, `Execution`) — named and shaped to
      mirror the backend SQLAlchemy models in
      `api-backend/app/models/reconciliation.py`
      (`IBActivity` = AF / Activity export, `IBTrade` = TCF /
      Trade-Confirmation export). Column names are the exact
      camelCase CSV header tokens the backend stores 1:1. When
      the API lands, its payload deserializes straight into these.

   2. VIEW types (`ReconTrade`, `CompareField`, `ExecRow`, …) —
      the shapes the screens render. These are DERIVED from the
      domain types by the mapper in `lib/mobo/reconciliation.ts`;
      they are never hand-authored inside components.

   DATA REALITY (see 001 §6): only stored-IB data exists today.
   There is no trader feed and no live-IB fetch. So:
     - The stored-IB column is the only populated source.
     - Trader and fetched-IB columns are surfaced as empty,
       "awaiting source" — NOT as breaks.
     - Identifiers are the real ibOrderID / orderID; no synthetic
       TRD-/CRM- refs.
     - The verdict is order-to-order, spanning order + execution
       fields; an execution break propagates up to the order.
     - There is NO FX-rate break in the vocabulary.
     - The IB↔CRM leg follows the original Claude-Design model:
       live IB (source of truth) vs the stored CRM copy, with a
       sync verdict (synced / stale / drift / missingDb / orphaned).
       The underlying storage shape (ib_activity / ib_trades) is a
       DB-level concern and is deliberately NOT surfaced here — the
       database will be reworked, so the UI stays decoupled from it.
